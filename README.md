Retrobox gives users a chance to witness past in a modern way. through our project users can watch youtube(both live and library) and listen to music but not on their smart TV, or smart phones but on a CRT TV and on a radio.
Users can move through the entire room.

Now, we have given a hosted link of our website and you directly click on the link and access the website.
You will directly land inside the room, you can use your mouse/touchpad and some keys(mentioned on our website) to move around in the room.
To test our project, you can either use the given hosted link or you can clone our repo and do it.

once you clone our repository, you will have to follow some commands to run the code, open your terminal(bash recommended), type 'npm install". This installs some depedencies in your system. 

once that is done, type 'npm run dev'. 
This will redirect you to the website.
make sure to have node package manager previously installed.
