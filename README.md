Retrobox gives users a chance to witness past in a modern way. through our project users can watch youtube and listen to podcasts but not on their smart TV, or smart phones but on a CRT TV and on a radio.
Users can move through the entire room.

Now, we have given a hosted link of our website and you directly click on the link and access the website.
you will directly land inside the room, you can use your mouse/touchpad and some keys(mentioned on our website) to move around in the room.
